# Autodash
# AI Dashboard Maker

This project is an AI-assisted data analysis and dashboard automation tool built using Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and machine learning utilities. It allows users to upload a dataset (CSV or Excel) and automatically generates interactive dashboards, insights, and visual reports without requiring manual coding or technical expertise.

The system processes raw data, detects missing values, formats columns, performs statistical evaluations, and converts the dataset into meaningful visualizations. Users can explore trends, patterns, descriptive summaries, and chart-based analysis through a clean, interactive web interface.

This project is especially useful for analysts, business intelligence users, students, researchers, and data scientists who want quick data exploration without writing code. The solution can serve as a foundation for automated reporting systems, AI BI-tools, and rapid exploratory data analysis workflows.
